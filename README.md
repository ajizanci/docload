# docload
A simple way to download all subroutes of a given url as static pages (HTML, CSS and JS files).

## Installation:
Install the docload package globally with `npm install -g docload`
Before you can use the app, you need to set the `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable to whatever directory of your choice. This lets Apify keep track of visited urls and store data.

## Help:
`docload --help`
